# CPE_matchstick
This is the game of the matches (if you remove the last match, you lose), your opponent is a little AI created by me :)

first compile the programme with 'make'

then try it : Example : ./matchstick 3 3

first number is the number of lines

second number is the maximum number of match we can remove in one time
